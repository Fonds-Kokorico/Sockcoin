        <h3>Welcome to the World of Sock Coin: The Stylish Meme Coin Serving Its Community! <span class="emoji">ðŸŽ‰</span></h3>
        
        <p>Sock Coin is a collective adventure where everyone gets a lot of Socks. Imagine this: 80% of the total supply is distributed to the community! Here's how it works:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50% at a Free Price:</strong> For 5 days, you can send any amount of BNB to this wallet, and based on your contribution, a percentage of Sock Coin will be allocated to you. The more you give, the more you receive, and the less likely you'll have cold feet!</li>
            
            <li><strong>30% in AirDrop:</strong> Who doesn't have holey Socks or cold feet? 30% of the total supply will be airdropped to the community. The percentage you receive will depend on your initial participation. Simple and effective! Be generous, and we will be too!</li>
            
            <li><strong>10% Reserved for Liquidity Pools:</strong> Once the 50% supply and the AirDrop have been distributed, liquidity pools will be created to ensure stability and smooth transactions. You will be able to trade your Sock Coins with ease.</li>
            
            <li><strong>5% for the Team:</strong> Because a good team deserves its reward, 5% of the supply is reserved for those working hard to make Sock Coin a success.</li>
            
            <li><strong>5% for CEX:</strong> Finally, 5% of the supply is reserved for centralized exchanges (CEX), ensuring maximum visibility and optimal accessibility.</li>
        </ul>
